# Bit Bot
## Robot/Pitch Shift Effect
This is a small, simplified clone of the Death by Audio Robot guitar pedal, stripped down to be installed in toys/keyboards as a mod.

## Notes:
* Can Connect Pin 3 of Control Pot to Ground via a Capacitor (~47nF) to mod the control
* Add a Wet/Dry Control by Attaching a 100K Lin pot to:
  * Clean/Effect Input (pin 1)
  * Output Jack/Speaker (pin 2)
  * Effect Output (pin 3)
